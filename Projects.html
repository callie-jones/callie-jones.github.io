    <h4>Big Data Architecture Course Project</h4>
    <p>As a part of my Big Data Architecture course, My team and I created an application
        that consumed historical Tweets that included the handle of
        Fortune 500 companies based on date. We then used a Apache Spark to <!DOCTYPE html>
        sentiment analysis and classify each Tweet as postive, negative or neutral.
        We collected those companies' stock price and created a graph that compared
        the Twitter data for that company to the companies stock price for that day.
        The user could search for one of the 500 Fortune companies to see a graph
        of that companies' stock performance compared to Tweets that mentioned
        the company's Twitter handle.

    <h4>Object-Oriented & Design Course Project</h4>
    <p>On a team of four developers we created a web application called Rent-A-Pup
        where users can schedule visits with available shelter dogs. Our
        application included support for authenticated user login, search 
        functionality, and a scheduler for users to schedule visits with shelter
        animals. Future improvements included secure payment portal, user password
        recovery, and the ability for shelters to manage the 
        available animal's profile pages.
    </p>
    <p>
        In creating this web application we used Java as our backend, JavaScript
        as our frontend, MongoDb as our database, and Java Servlets using Maven.

    <h4> Sabermetrics Course Project</h4>
    <p>As a part of my final project for this course, I created my own baseball
        statistic. I was very interested in statcast statistics including
        exit velocity, launch angle, and spin rate. I created a rough
        statistic that measures the pitcher's ability to suppress the exit
        velocity based on statcast data. My approach was to calculate a
        suppression value which was expected exit velocity - actual exit velocity,
        My suppression rate statistic attempts to quantify the quality of a pitch
        based on how well a pitcher can control the quality of contact.

    <h4>Software Methods & Tools Course Project</h4>
    <p>On a team of five developers we created an application that allowed
        students of CU Boulder to place online orders for the university's
        Grab'n Go locations. These locations are intended to be a quick stop
        for students to buy food using the funds on their student Id card
        or another form of payment. Unfortunately at peak hours the wait to
        receive an order can be up to an hour.
    </p>
    <p>We developed our application on two platforms: iOS and web. The iOS
        application used Firebase to store user data, orders placed and was
        developed using Swift. The web application used MongoDB to store
        user data and orders placed and was developed using JavaScript and
        Node.js.
