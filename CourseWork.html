    <h4>Machine Learning Practicum</h4>
    <p>As a part of my practicum, I was given a data set of 4000 tweets
        in order to create classifiers to predict whether a tweet was sent
        by Hillary Clinton or by Donald Trump. Using Logistic Regression
        and Naive Bayes, I classified the data with the Naive Bayes performing
        the best with an accuracy of 93.1. Perhaps the most challenging problem
        was to use only Logistic Regression but to improve performance by
        creating better features to classify the data. I used cross-validation
        to evaluate my features. Using the test data, I achieved an
        accuracy of 92.625. We also had a Kaggle competition where students
        submitted their predictions. My Kaggle accuracy score was 90.583.

    <h4>Network Systems Distributed File System</h4>
    <p>In this exercise, one Distributed File Client uploads and downloads
        files onto and from 4 Distributed File Servers. When the client uploads
        a file to the 4 servers, it first splits the file into 4 equal length
        pieces and then groups the 4 pieces into 4 pairs and finally uploads the
        file pieces onto the 4 servers. To determine which file pairs were
        uploaded to which servers I used MD5 hash of the file name % 4. This
        solution was also multi-threaded where the servers could serve multiple
        clients concurrently.
